# Economic-freedom-EDA

Some EDA on economic freedom with respect to PPP.
Data from https://www.heritage.org/index/explore

Note: Didn't Include Mexico (and the Carribean Islands) in NA category because its only in NA geographically, culturally far from it. 

Also note: Correlation != Causation, so take correlations with a grain of salt.

Also could use some PCA, but some fields are derived from one another, so that might make it useless.

Also dropping zero rows probably messed up the data more than it should have for Africa and SA, I should consider imputing values instead.
